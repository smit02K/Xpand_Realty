## Introduction
In today's educational landscape, AR technology offers an innovative approach to learning by presenting content in 3D perspectives. This project aims to enhance education by providing a platform where students can easily comprehend and retain complex concepts. Unity was chosen as the development platform due to its robust 3D modeling capabilities and seamless integration with AR.

## Features
- Immersive 3D-based learning experience.
- User-friendly interface for easy navigation.
- Integration of 3D models with AR for visualizing intricate subjects.
- Plane detection techniques to enhance the interaction with the physical environment.
- Multiple screens for a structured learning journey.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/smit02K/Xpand_Realty`
2. Open the project in Unity.
3. Make sure you have the necessary AR-related plugins and packages installed.
4. Build and run the application on your preferred platform.

## Usage
1. Launch the application on your AR-capable device.
2. Explore the welcome screen and main menu.
3. Navigate through individual subjects to access corresponding 3D models.
4. Interact with models to view 2D images and read descriptions.
5. Experience plane detection and augmentation in the real world.

## Screens
The application consists of the following screens:
1. **Welcome Screen**: Introduction to the application.
2. **Main Menu**: Central hub for navigating to different subjects.
3. **Subject Screens**: Dedicated screens for each subject, featuring interactive 3D models.
4. **Model Screens**: Detailed view of 3D models, including 2D images and descriptions.
5. **Plane Detection**: Highlighting physical surfaces and enhancing them with virtual objects.
6. **Augmented Reality View**: The core AR experience where virtual elements merge with the real world.

## Technologies
- Unity: The game engine used for development.
- Augmented Reality (AR): Enhancing learning through immersive visualizations.
- Figma: To create user interface (UI) of application
